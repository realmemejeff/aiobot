[quad_gantry_level]
#gantry_corners:
#   A newline separated list of X, Y coordinates describing the two
#   opposing corners of the gantry. The first entry corresponds to Z,
#   the second to Z2. This parameter must be provided.
#points:
#   A newline separated list of four X, Y points that should be probed
#   during a QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL command. Order of the locations is
#   important, and should correspond to Z, Z1, Z2, and Z3 location in
#   order. This parameter must be provided. For maximum accuracy,
#   ensure your probe offsets are configured.
#speed: 50
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#max_adjust: 4
#   Safety limit if an adjustment greater than this value is requested
#   quad_gantry_level will abort.
#retries: 0
#   Number of times to retry if the probed points aren't within

#   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed
#   points differ more than retry_tolerance.




[z_tilt]
#z_positions:
#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) describing the location of each bed "pivot point". The
#   "pivot point" is the point where the bed attaches to the given Z
#   stepper. It is described using nozzle coordinates (the X, Y position
#   of the nozzle if it could move directly above the point). The
#   first entry corresponds to stepper_z, the second to stepper_z1,
#   the third to stepper_z2, etc. This parameter must be provided.

#   A list of X, Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) that should be probed during a Z_TILT_ADJUST command.
#   Specify coordinates of the nozzle and be sure the probe is above
#   the bed at the given nozzle coordinates. This parameter must be
#   provided.

#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
#horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to

#retry_tolerance: 0
#   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed

#   change here would be a single step. However if you are probing
#   more points than steppers then you will likely have a fixed
#   minimum value for the range of probed points which you can learn
#   by observing command output.




[bed_mesh]

#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#mesh_radius:
#   Defines the radius of the mesh to probe for round beds. Note that
#   the radius is relative to the coordinate specified by the
#   mesh_origin option. This parameter must be provided for round beds
#   and omitted for rectangular beds.
#mesh_origin:
#   Defines the center X, Y coordinate of the mesh for round beds. This
#   coordinate is relative to the probe's location. It may be useful
#   to adjust the mesh_origin in an effort to maximize the size of the
#   mesh radius. Default is 0, 0. This parameter must be omitted for
#   rectangular beds.
#mesh_min:
#   Defines the minimum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. This coordinate is relative to the probe's location. This
#   will be the first point probed, nearest to the origin. This
#   parameter must be provided for rectangular beds.
#mesh_max:
#   Defines the maximum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. Adheres to the same principle as mesh_min, however this will
#   be the furthest point probed from the bed's origin. This parameter
#   must be provided for rectangular beds.
#probe_count: 3, 3
#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values X, Y defining the number of points to probe along each
#   axis. A single value is also valid, in which case that value will
#   be applied to both axes. Default is 3, 3.
#round_probe_count: 5
#   For round beds, this integer value defines the maximum number of
#   points to probe along each axis. This value must be an odd number.
#   Default is 5.
#fade_start: 1.0
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled. Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 0.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes. When set to a
#   value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be noted that
#   fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a print. If a
#   user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is recommended.
#   Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is
#   set to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in
#   the mesh. Users that wish to converge to the z homing position
#   should set this to 0. Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will trigger
#   a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2, 2
#   A comma separated pair of integers X, Y defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed point.
#   The user may enter a single value which will be applied to both
#   axes. Default is 2, 2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange" or
#   "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which are forced
#   to use lagrange sampling. Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above may
#   be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated. Larger
#   numbers will increase the amount of slope, which results in more
#   curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
#zero_reference_position:
#   An optional X,Y coordinate that specifies the location on the bed
#   where Z = 0.  When this option is specified the mesh will be offset
#   so that zero Z adjustment occurs at this location.  The default is
#   no zero reference.
#faulty_region_1_min:
#faulty_region_1_max:
#   Optional points that define a faulty region.  See docs/Bed_Mesh.md
#   for details on faulty regions.  Up to 99 faulty regions may be added.
#   By default no faulty regions are set.
#adaptive_margin:
#   An optional margin (in mm) to be added around the bed area used by
#   the defined print objects when generating an adaptive mesh.
#scan_overshoot:
#  The maximum amount of travel (in mm) available outside of the mesh.
#  For rectangular beds this applies to travel on the X axis, and for round beds
#  it applies to the entire radius.  The tool must be able to travel the amount
#  specified outside of the mesh.  This value is used to optimize the travel
#  path when performing a "rapid scan".  The minimum value that may be specified
#  is 1.  The default is no overshoot.




[z_thermal_adjust]
#temp_coeff:
#   The temperature coefficient of expansion, in mm/degC. For example, a
#   temp_coeff of 0.01 mm/degC will move the Z axis downwards by 0.01 mm for
#   every degree Celsius that the temperature sensor increases. Defaults to
#   0.0 mm/degC, which applies no adjustment.
#smooth_time:
#   Smoothing window applied to the temperature sensor, in seconds. Can reduce
#   motor noise from excessive small corrections in response to sensor noise.
#   The default is 2.0 seconds.
#z_adjust_off_above:
#   Disables adjustments above this Z height [mm]. The last computed correction
#   will remain applied until the toolhead moves below the specified Z height
#   again. The default is 99999999.0 mm (always on).

#   performed. This parameter must be provided.
#speed: 50.0
#   Speed at which the toolhead is moved to the safe Z home
#   coordinate. The default is 50 mm/s
#z_hop:
#   Distance (in mm) to lift the Z axis prior to homing. This is
#   applied to any homing command, even if it doesn't home the Z axis.
#   If the Z axis is already homed and the current Z position is less
#   than z_hop, then this will lift the head to a height of z_hop. If
#   the Z axis is not already homed the head is lifted by z_hop.
#   The default is to not implement Z hop.
#z_hop_speed: 15.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) at which the Z axis is lifted prior to homing. The
#   default is 15 mm/s.
#move_to_previous: False

#   positions after Z axis homing. The default is False.




[firmware_retraction]
#retract_length: 0
#   The length of filament (in mm) to retract when G10 is activated,

[input_shaper]
#shaper_freq_x: 0
#   A frequency (in Hz) of the input shaper for X axis. This is
#   usually a resonance frequency of X axis that the input shaper
#   should suppress. For more complex shapers, like 2- and 3-hump EI
#   input shapers, this parameter can be set from different
#   considerations. The default value is 0, which disables input
#   shaping for X axis.
#shaper_freq_y: 0
#   A frequency (in Hz) of the input shaper for Y axis. This is
#   usually a resonance frequency of Y axis that the input shaper
#   should suppress. For more complex shapers, like 2- and 3-hump EI
#   input shapers, this parameter can be set from different
#   considerations. The default value is 0, which disables input
#   shaping for Y axis.
#shaper_type: mzv
#   A type of the input shaper to use for both X and Y axes. Supported
#   shapers are zv, mzv, zvd, ei, 2hump_ei, and 3hump_ei. The default
#   is mzv input shaper.
#shaper_type_x:
#shaper_type_y:
#   If shaper_type is not set, these two parameters can be used to
#   configure different input shapers for X and Y axes. The same
#   values are supported as for shaper_type parameter.
#damping_ratio_x: 0.1
#damping_ratio_y: 0.1
#   Damping ratios of vibrations of X and Y axes used by input shapers
#   to improve vibration suppression. Default value is 0.1 which is a
#   good all-round value for most printers. In most circumstances this
#   parameter requires no tuning and should not be changed.

#   See the "common SPI settings" section for a description of the
#   above parameters.
#axes_map: x, y, z
#   The accelerometer axis for each of the printer's X, Y, and Z axes.
#   This may be useful if the accelerometer is mounted in an
#   orientation that does not match the printer orientation. For
#   example, one could set this to "y, x, z" to swap the X and Y axes.
#   It is also possible to negate an axis if the accelerometer
#   direction is reversed (eg, "x, z, -y"). The default is "x, y, z".

#   Output data rate for ADXL345. ADXL345 supports the following data
#   rates: 3200, 1600, 800, 400, 200, 100, 50, and 25. Note that it is
#   not recommended to change this rate from the default 3200, and
#   rates below 800 will considerably affect the quality of resonance
#   measurements.




[resonance_tester]
#probe_points:
#   A list of X, Y, Z coordinates of points (one point per line) to test
#   resonances at. At least one point is required. Make sure that all
#   points with some safety margin in XY plane (~a few centimeters)
#   are reachable by the toolhead.
#accel_chip:
#   A name of the accelerometer chip to use for measurements. If
#   adxl345 chip was defined without an explicit name, this parameter
#   can simply reference it as "accel_chip: adxl345", otherwise an
#   explicit name must be supplied as well, e.g. "accel_chip: adxl345
#   my_chip_name". Either this, or the next two parameters must be
#   set.
#accel_chip_x:
#accel_chip_y:
#   Names of the accelerometer chips to use for measurements for each
#   of the axis. Can be useful, for instance, on bed slinger printer,
#   if two separate accelerometers are mounted on the bed (for Y axis)
#   and on the toolhead (for X axis). These parameters have the same
#   format as 'accel_chip' parameter. Only 'accel_chip' or these two
#   parameters must be provided.
#max_smoothing:
#   Maximum input shaper smoothing to allow for each axis during shaper
#   auto-calibration (with 'SHAPER_CALIBRATE' command). By default no

#min_freq: 5
#   Minimum frequency to test for resonances. The default is 5 Hz.
#max_freq: 133.33
#   Maximum frequency to test for resonances. The default is 133.33 Hz.
#accel_per_hz: 75
#   This parameter is used to determine which acceleration to use to
#   test a specific frequency: accel = accel_per_hz * freq. Higher the
#   value, the higher is the energy of the oscillations. Can be set to
#   a lower than the default value if the resonances get too strong on
#   the printer. However, lower values make measurements of
#   high-frequency resonances less precise. The default value is 75
#   (mm/sec).
#hz_per_sec: 1
#   Determines the speed of the test. When testing all frequencies in
#   range [min_freq, max_freq], each second the frequency increases by
#   hz_per_sec. Small values make the test slow, and the large values
#   will decrease the precision of the test. The default value is 1.0
#   (Hz/sec == sec^-2).




sensor_type: BME280
#i2c_address:
#   Default is 118 (0x76). The BMP180, BMP388 and some BME280 sensors
#   have an address of 119 (0x77).
#i2c_mcu:
#i2c_bus:

#   PAUSE is complete. The default is not to run any G-Code commands.
#insert_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after a filament insert is
#   detected. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. The
#   default is not to run any G-Code commands, which disables insert
